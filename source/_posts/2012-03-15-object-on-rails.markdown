{% blockquote Avdi Grimm , http://objectsonrails.com/ Object on Rails  %}

This is the complete text of Objects on Rails, a "developer's notebook" documenting some guidelines, techniques, and ideas for applying classic object-oriented thought to Ruby on Rails applications. This book is aimed at the working Rails developer who is looking to grow and evolve Rails projects while keeping them flexible, maintainable, and robust. The focus is on pragmatic solutions which tread a "middle way" between the expedience of the Rails "golden path", and rigid OO purity.
